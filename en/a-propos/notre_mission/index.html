<p>The research in social science of Datactivist&rsquo;s founders entertained a belief that it is essential to <strong>put users at the centre of open data policies</strong>. In his <a href="http://www.theses.fr/2016ENST0045">doctoral dissertation</a>, Samuel Goëta showed that the datasets published on open data portals often come out of the logic of the offer: the administrations employees choose the datasets to be open and how they will be published without taking into account the users needs about data.</p>
<p>In his work on electoral sociology, Joël Gombin has experienced <strong>the limits of open data:</strong> : too aggregated, rarely updated, poorly documented, sometimes unusable. And, for administration employees, it’s a lot of work for datasets that are sometimes little used or not used.</p>
<p>It is our wish to <strong>put our expertise into data producers and reusers</strong>, that made us create Datactivist, to open data and make them used and useful.</p>
<p>The cooperative company quickly expanded to <strong>support organizations of all types</strong> (public sector, companies, NGOs) about the opening of their data, the uses and requests of open data.</p>
<p><strong>As an open data pure player</strong>, we help our customers through consulting activities ranging from the definition to the operational implementation of an open data strategy ; training that puts open data in the general context of the data revolution and data science ; and facilitation to help data reuse by experts and beginners.</p>
